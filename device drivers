Device drivers are software components that allow computer hardware devices to communicate with the operating system and other software applications. These drivers act as a bridge between the hardware and software, enabling the operating system to interact with the device and control its functions.

The study of device drivers involves understanding the different types of drivers, how they work, and how to develop and maintain them. Some of the key areas of study include:

Driver architecture: This involves understanding the architecture of device drivers, including the hardware and software components, and how they interact with each other.

Driver programming: This involves learning how to write device drivers using programming languages such as C, C++, and Assembly language.

Driver debugging and troubleshooting: This involves understanding how to diagnose and fix problems with device drivers, such as device conflicts, driver errors, and compatibility issues.

Driver testing: This involves learning how to test device drivers to ensure they are working correctly and are compatible with the operating system and other software applications.

Driver maintenance: This involves understanding how to maintain device drivers, including updating them to work with new hardware and software, fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities, and optimizing performance.

Overall, the study of device drivers is a complex and important area of computer science that is essential for ensuring the proper functioning of computer hardware devices and software applications.


The functions of a device driver can be broken down into the following steps:

Initialization: When a device driver is loaded into memory, it goes through an initialization process to set up the necessary data structures, allocate memory, and initialize the hardware.

Communication: The device driver provides a set of functions that the operating system can use to communicate with the hardware device. These functions can be used to read data from the device, write data to the device, control the device's settings, and perform other operations.

Interrupt handling: Hardware devices can generate interrupts to signal the CPU that they need attention. When an interrupt occurs, the device driver is responsible for handling it and taking the necessary actions. For example, if a network card receives a packet, it will generate an interrupt to the CPU, and the device driver will handle the interrupt by copying the packet data to a buffer in memory.

Memory management: Device drivers need to manage memory resources to ensure that they don't run out of memory or overwrite important system data. The device driver may allocate memory for buffers, data structures, and other resources, and release the memory when it's no longer needed.

Error handling: Device drivers need to be able to handle errors and exceptions that can occur during operation. For example, if a device driver tries to write to a hardware device that is no longer connected, it should report an error and handle the situation gracefully.

1. Kernel device drivers
Kernel device drivers consist of some generic hardware loaded with the operating system (OS) as part of the OS. They include motherboards, processors, and BIOS. They are invoked and loaded into the random-access memory (RAM) when required. When several of them are operating at the same time, the machine can slow down. Thus, there is a minimum requirement for each OS. 

Kernel device drivers are layered. Higher-level drivers, such as file system drivers, receive data from applications, filter it, and pass it to a lower-level driver, supporting drive functionality. Kernel device drivers are implemented as discrete and modular components that have a well-defined set of required functionalities.

2. User-mode device drivers
User mode device drivers execute in user mode. They refer to device drivers that users may trigger during a session. When using a system, users may have their own external devices that they bring to use, such as external plug-and-play devices. These devices also require drivers to function. In Windows systems, user-mode device drivers provide an interface between a Win32 application and kernel-mode drivers or other operating systems. Users can write these drivers to the disk to reduce strain on computer resources.

3. Character drivers
Character device drivers provide unstructured access to the hardware. They transfer data to and from devices without using a specific device address. They allow the reading or writing of one byte at a time as a stream of sequential data. Character drivers do not handle input/output (I/O) through the buffer cache, so they are more flexible in handling I/O. They are paired with block devices to circumvent the buffer cache to offer raw I/O operations straight to the program address space of the user.

Additionally, they provide additional interfaces such as I/O control commands, device polling, and memory mapping. Examples are modems and bus controllers.

4. Block drivers
Block device drivers provide structured access to the hardware. They use file system block-sized buffers from a buffer cache supplied by the kernel to perform I/O. A buffer cache is a memory pool established by the kernel to store frequently accessed blocks via block devices. The buffer cache reduces the amount of I/O queries that need an I/O operation from the device.

In addition, block device drivers provide accessible block-oriented I/O and demonstrate data durability. They take a file system request and issue the I/O procedures to the disk to transfer the requested block. Examples are USB memory keys and disk drives.

5. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) drivers
Device drivers can be categorized as generic or OEM-related. Generic drivers refer to device drivers with their operating software bundled into the OEM hardware. One can use generic drivers with different brands of a particular device type. For instance, Linux works with several generic drivers that function without the need to install any other software manually. 

OEMs can create their proprietary device drivers, which need to be installed separately after installing the OS. OEM drivers enable hardware such as keyboards to communicate with the host OS. For instance, OEM drivers enable functions such as integrating the lighting control system with OEM hardware in Google Assistant and Alexa.

6. Virtual device drivers
Virtual device drivers are essential in controlling virtual machines or VMs. They operate in both virtualization and non-virtualization environments. In virtualization environments, these drivers are used to emulate the hardware of the host device. They control or manage the resource hardware of the host device to ensure that both the guest and host device run as expected. 

For example, when a guest operating system works on a host, it makes function calls to virtual device drivers to access the hardware. In addition, they imitate processor-level occurrences like interrupts and transmit them to the virtual machine.

7. BIOS
The basic input output system (BIOS) is the most fundamental driver on a computer. It is located in a read-only memory (ROM) chip, which ensures that BIOS will be available even when the hard disk is formatted. It is in charge of booting a computer and providing it with a set of instructions during this process. It also performs power-on self-tests (POST) that are required during startup. The BIOS also provides drivers for the basic hardware, such as keyboards and monitors, to ensure that they interface with the operating system to function as intended.

8. Motherboard drivers
Motherboard drivers are simple applications that both Windows and Linux may utilize. They exist within the operating system and enable fundamental computer operations. These drivers comprise applications that allow the keyboard and mouse’s USB devices and I/O ports to work. Some motherboards have drivers that support video and audio.

Motherboard drivers are specific for the chipset model, such as B460 for Intel computers. To realize the motherboard’s full potential and enable components connected to it to work correctly, users may need to install additional drivers.

9. Open-source drivers
Open-source drivers refer to drivers that are released under a free and open-source license. For instance, open-source graphic drivers control the output to the display if the display is part of the graphics hardware. The source code for open-source drivers is available to everyone, making software collaborations easier. They are more trustworthy as people can check them for any malicious code.

Open-source drivers offer more privacy. If they track users, people can redistribute a copy of the software with the tracking removed. Open-source drivers last longer as more people continue to make improvements, thus ensuring that even when the company stops distributing them, a copy remains.




Applications of Device Drivers
These essential building blocks of personal and enterprise computing are used in the following ways:

1. Device drivers for accessing storage systems
Computer storage systems allow users to store data and make it available on demand. They include external and internal devices such as USB flash drives, hard drives, and network-attached storage. Drivers in storage systems enable them to interact with the computer. This ensures that the computer can access its internal or external storage systems, query their information, and allow data transfer.  

Connecting storage devices to the computer without drivers becomes difficult as the OS does not detect them. Usually, hard disks and CD-ROMs are recognized by the OS and do not require drivers to be manually installed. Users must install drivers from the manufacturer’s website if they are not automatically detected.

2. Device drivers for input and output devices
The computer’s OS interacts with device drivers to ensure its hardware functions as expected. Input devices include mice and keyboards, while output devices include display devices such as monitors. Keyboards, mice, and monitors are categorized as plug-and-play devices. 

Usually, the drivers for plug-and-play devices are generic and do not require manual installation, as the computer’s OS recognizes them and installs them automatically. However, if an external device is not a plug-and-play device, users may need to manually install the drivers from the installation disc or download them. This will enable the OS to recognize these devices.

3. Device drivers for digital cameras
A digital camera driver is a program that allows communication between it and other devices, such as computers. Without the drivers, the OS will not detect this device. Most digital cameras are only compatible with the Windows OS, as Linux systems lag.

Digital camera drivers allow for the transfer of photos from the camera to the computer. They enable digital cameras to print photos using the PictBridge standard directly to a PictBridge-capable computer printer without needing a computer. Drivers in the video output port allow users to display pictures on television by selecting one video or photo at a time.

4. Drivers for mobile operating systems like Android
Mobile phones have drivers to enable them to communicate with computers. Drivers come bundled with the firmware on most phones, which allows computers to load them up to support hardware as the OS is not specified. However, sometimes users may need to install OEM PC software first for drivers to be installed and allow data transfer.

Drivers allow for the integration of peripheral devices such as game controllers or keyboards based on operating systems such as Android Things and Android. The drivers enable access and control of the hardware. Additionally, they allow smart devices to work with custom applications.

5. Device drivers for superior video performance
Graphic cards are core components of a computer system and are responsible for superior video performance in computers, games, or other graphic-intensive tasks. Graphic drivers allow graphic cards to interact with the computer’s operating system and are thus essential to getting top performance from the graphic cards.
